The dataset is structured around a classic vehicle retailer with multiple warehouses. Below are the tables, columns, relationships, and business insights.
  ==========================================================================================================================================================

🔹 1. warehouses

Purpose: Defines the storage facilities.

Column	Type	Description	Context / Insights
warehouseCode	CHAR(1) Primary Key	Unique warehouse identifier (A–D).	Key link to products.
warehouseName	VARCHAR	Human-readable name (North, East, West, South).	Useful in reporting.
warehousePctCap	INT	Normalized “capacity points” (not physical sqft, but relative storage capacity).	Used to test headroom and feasibility of closure.

👉 Insights: warehousePctCap lets us compute utilization % and check if other warehouses can absorb inventory if one closes.

🔹 2. products

Purpose: Master list of SKUs (vehicles or vehicle-related items).

Column	Type	Description	Context / Insights
productCode	VARCHAR Primary Key	Unique product identifier.	Primary key for joins.
productName	VARCHAR	Name of the vehicle/item.	Used in reports.
productLine	VARCHAR Foreign  Key	Category (e.g., Vintage Cars, Classic Motorcycles).	Groups for ABC analysis.
productScale	VARCHAR	Scale (model-to-life, e.g., 1:10).	Useful for clustering similar SKUs.
productVendor	VARCHAR	Supplier/vendor.	Can reveal vendor dependency.
productDescription	TEXT	Description of vehicle/item.	Metadata.
quantityInStock	INT	Current on-hand units.	Used in inventory analysis.
buyPrice	DECIMAL	Purchase cost per unit.	Basis for inventory valuation and COGS proxy.
MSRP	DECIMAL	Suggested retail price.	Basis for margin analysis.
warehouseCode	CHAR(1) FK	Which warehouse stores this SKU.	Critical for warehouse-level views.

👉 Insights:

Stock distribution across warehouses.

Profitability proxy = MSRP − buyPrice.

Over/understocking flagged via quantityInStock vs demand.

Dead stock detection = quantityInStock > 0 and no sales in 12 months.

🔹 3. productlines

Purpose: Category hierarchy.

Column	Type	Description
productLine	VARCHAR PK	Product category name.
textDescription	TEXT	Category description.

👉 Insights: Useful for ABC classification and segment analysis.

🔹 4. orders

Purpose: Sales order header.

Column	Type	Description
orderNumber	INT Primary Key	Unique order ID.
orderDate	DATE	When order was placed.
requiredDate	DATE	Required delivery date.
shippedDate	DATE	Actual ship date.
status	VARCHAR	Status (Shipped, Cancelled, On Hold).
comments	TEXT	Notes.
customerNumber	INT Foreign Key	Who ordered.

👉 Insights: Order trends (seasonality), fulfillment lead times (shippedDate − orderDate), cancellation analysis.

🔹 5. orderdetails

Purpose: Sales order line items.

Column	Type	Description	Context / Insights
orderNumber	INT PK FK	Links to orders.	
productCode	VARCHAR PK FK	Links to products.	
quantityOrdered	INT	Units sold in this order.	
priceEach	DECIMAL	Selling price per unit.	
orderLineNumber	SMALLINT	Line number within order.	

👉 Insights:

Sales velocity (SUM(quantityOrdered)).

Revenue = quantityOrdered * priceEach.

COGS proxy = quantityOrdered * buyPrice.

Profitability proxy = revenue − COGS.

🔹 6. customers

Column	Type	Description
customerNumber	INT PK	Customer ID.
customerName	VARCHAR	Name.
