# Inventory-Management
EDA and Business Insights of Car Inventory Data and Providing Business Insights using a relational database model in MySQL
Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is looking at closing one of their storage facilities.  Goal is to isolate and identify those parts of the data that could be useful in deciding how to reduce inventory by answering questions like these:
1) Where are items stored and if they were rearranged, could a warehouse be eliminated?
2) How are inventory numbers related to sales figures? Do the inventory counts seem appropriate for each item?
3) Are we storing items that are not moving? Are any items candidates for being dropped from the product line?
Project Objectives
1. Exploring products currently in inventory.
2. Determining important factors that may influence inventory reorganisation/reduction.
3. Providing analytic insights and data-driven recommendations.
Conducting  an exploratory data analysis to investigate if there are any patterns or themes that may influence the reduction or reorganisation of inventory in the Mint Classics storage facilities.
